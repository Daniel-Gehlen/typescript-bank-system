Technical Report: Implementation of Login System and User Information Display

Objective:
The objective of this technical report is to outline the implementation of a login system with password validation, using React and Context API, and to create a user information page that can only be accessed by authenticated users. Additionally, the deployment of the application on Netlify is discussed.

1. Login System Implementation:

Validation of Password: Implemented password validation logic in the login form. The user is required to provide both email and password for authentication. If the password provided by the user matches the expected password, the login is successful; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
Context API Usage: Employed React Context API to manage global state related to user authentication. The AuthProvider component is used to provide the authentication context to the entire application. It includes functions to perform login and logout operations, as well as state management for the authenticated user.
2. User Information Display Page:

Restricted Access: Created a page to display user information, which can only be accessed by authenticated users. If a user attempts to access this page without being logged in, they are redirected to the login page.
Context API Integration: Utilized the AuthContext provided by the AuthProvider to determine the authentication status of the user. If the user is authenticated, their information is displayed on the user information page; otherwise, they are redirected to the login page.
3. Deployment on Netlify:

Continuous Deployment: Deployed the application on the Netlify platform using continuous deployment. The application is linked to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub), allowing for automatic deployment upon code changes.
Sharing Deployment Link: Upon successful deployment, the link to the deployed application is generated and shared. Users can access the application through this link, and any subsequent changes pushed to the repository will be automatically reflected in the deployed version.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the implementation successfully fulfills the requirements specified in the prompt. A secure login system with password validation has been developed using React and Context API. Additionally, a user information page has been created, accessible only to authenticated users. The application has been deployed on Netlify, providing easy access to users via the deployment link. Overall, the implementation ensures user authentication and data privacy while providing a seamless user experience.
